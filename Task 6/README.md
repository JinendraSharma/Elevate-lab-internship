#  Password Strength Checker – Report

This Report evaluates password strength based on length, complexity, and uniqueness.  
It explains what makes a password strong and how complexity improves security against common attacks.

##  Strong Password Guidelines
- Use 12–16+ characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid personal info or common words
- Ensure each password is unique
- Prefer random passphrases

##  Why Complexity Matters
- Brute Force Defense: Expands the search space, making cracking impractical.  
- Dictionary Attack Resistance: Complex, random passwords avoid matches in wordlists.  
- Credential Stuffing Protection: Unique passwords prevent reuse across accounts.
  
- ##  Recommendations
- Use a password manager to generate/store strong passwords  
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
- Update passwords regularly for sensitive accounts
